# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs
In this repository, I want to examine two applications of CNNs in image processing and disease diagnosis.

## **Question 1.** Sallow CNN for image Classification [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question.1-Open-blue)]([https://github.com/ErfanPanahi/Mcculloch-Pitts-and-Fully-Connected-Neural-Networks/tree/main/Q1](https://github.com/ErfanPanahi/Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs/tree/main/Q1))

The use of deep neural networks for image classification has seen significant advancements. However, these networks are usually very deep and require substantial computational power and system memory. Additionally, the depth of these networks results in very long training times. In the attached paper ([SCNNB.pdf](https://github.com/ErfanPanahi/Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs/blob/main/Q1/Part1.pdf)), a new architecture is proposed that achieves accuracy nearly comparable to deep convolutional neural networks, but with fewer layers.

## **Question 2.** Classification of Chest X-Ray Images [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question.2-Open-green)]([https://github.com/ErfanPanahi/Mcculloch-Pitts-and-Fully-Connected-Neural-Networks/tree/main/Q2](https://github.com/ErfanPanahi/Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs/tree/main/Q2))

Pneumonia is a contagious and deadly disease that causes respiratory problems. A thorough examination of chest X-ray images is necessary for diagnosing this disease, which in turn requires a skilled and trained radiologist. Diagnosing pneumonia using chest X-rays is challenging even for trained physicians. The appearance of this disease in X-ray images is often ambiguous and can be mistaken for other diseases. This issue can lead to misdiagnosis. Convolutional neural networks are the most widely used machine learning algorithms for learning to diagnose diseases from images. Therefore, these networks can also be used to diagnose pneumonia.

In this exercise, we aim to classify chest X-ray images into two categories (normal and pneumonia) using EfficientNet. For this purpose, we will attempt to use the attached paper ([Part2.pdf](https://github.com/ErfanPanahi/Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs/blob/main/Q2/Part2.pdf)).
