Pneumonia is a contagious and deadly disease that causes respiratory problems. A thorough examination of chest X-ray images is necessary for diagnosing this disease, which in turn requires a skilled and trained radiologist. Diagnosing pneumonia using chest X-rays is challenging even for trained physicians. The appearance of this disease in X-ray images is often ambiguous and can be mistaken for other diseases. This issue can lead to misdiagnosis. Convolutional neural networks are the most widely used machine learning algorithms for learning to diagnose diseases from images. Therefore, these networks can also be used to diagnose pneumonia.

In this exercise, we aim to classify chest X-ray images into two categories (normal and pneumonia) using EfficientNet. For this purpose, we will attempt to use the attached paper ([Part2.pdf]()).
